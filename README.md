# DE-Enhanced-Neural-Network-Optimization:
Welcome to the Enhanced Differential Evolution for Neural Network Optimization repository! This project takes you on a journey of optimizing neural networks with a novel twist on Differential Evolution (DE) by incorporating boundary individual consideration. Let's dive into how this innovative approach pushes the boundaries of neural network optimization!

üöÄ Overview:
In the ever-evolving world of machine learning, finding the right neural network architecture can be a daunting task. Our research introduces an enhanced DE algorithm that ensures no stone is left unturned by strategically including boundary individuals during the mutation process. This ensures a thorough exploration of the search space, leading to robust and efficient hyperparameter optimization.

üìÑ Research Paper:
Our detailed research paper, "Enhancing Differential Evolution for Neural Network Optimization through Boundary Individual Consideration," is available here. This paper delves into the methodology, experimental setup, results, and groundbreaking conclusions.

Abstract:
The enhanced DE algorithm tackles the exploration challenges at the search space boundaries. When applied to an obesity level prediction dataset, it outperformed traditional DE methods in fitness scores, precision, and recall.

üßë‚Äçüíª Code:
The implementation of the enhanced DE algorithm is provided in the Jupyter notebook EML_Project_code.ipynb. The notebook includes the following sections:

Initialization: Randomly initializes a population of potential neural network architectures within predefined bounds.
Mutation: Implements a probabilistic mechanism for incorporating boundary individuals in the mutation process.
Crossover and Selection: Performs crossover and selection as per the standard DE process.
Fitness Evaluation: Trains neural networks with the generated architectures and evaluates their performance on a validation set.
Iteration: Repeats the mutation, crossover, selection, and fitness evaluation steps until the maximum number of generations is reached or an acceptable fitness level is achieved.
